Project Title: Sanskrit Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

1. Objective

The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of processing and answering queries based on Sanskrit documents. The system must operate fully on CPU-based inference.

2. Description

You are required to develop an end-to-end RAG pipeline that performs the following tasks:

Ingest Sanskrit documents (in .txt or .pdf format) on some domain.

Preprocess and index these documents for efficient retrieval.

Implement a query interface that accepts user input in Sanskrit or transliterated text.

Retrieve relevant context chunks from the indexed corpus.

Generate coherent responses using a CPU-based Large Language Model (LLM) integrated into the pipeline.

The RAG architecture should follow standard practices, ensuring modularity between the retriever and generator components.

3. Technical Requirements

Language of Source Documents: Sanskrit (attached in mail)

Model Inference: CPU only (no GPU usage permitted)

Core Components:

Document Loader and Preprocessor

Retriever (Vector or Keyword based)

Generator (LLM-based text generator)

Frameworks (allowed): Any open-source framework or library for retrieval and generation

Deployment Environment: Local or lightweight containerized setup

4. Expected Deliverables

Technical Report detailing:

System architecture and flow

Details of the Sanskrit documents used

Preprocessing pipeline for Sanskrit documents

Retrieval and generation mechanisms

Performance observations (latency, accuracy/relevant metric, resource usage)

Codebase containing:

Complete, runnable implementation

Clear instructions in a README.md for setup and execution

Configuration files (if applicable)

Demonstration Video (Optional) showing end-to-end query–response flow.
